# Native language-model workflows

The preferred LLM path is ComfyUI’s native text-generation nodes. They use
the loaded ComfyUI `CLIP` object, so tokenization, device placement,
DynamicVRAM, templates, and workflow serialization stay inside the normal
ComfyUI machinery.

## Native setup

Build a workflow with:

```text
CLIPLoader → TextGenerate → downstream conditioning/video/image node
```

`TextGenerate` accepts text and optional image, video, or audio inputs. Its
controls include maximum length, sampling mode, thinking mode, and an optional
model template. The node returns generated text and the updated conditioning
object expected by the rest of the workflow. `TextGenerateLTX2Prompt` provides
the native prompt-enhancement path for LTX-2 workflows.

Use the packaged workflow templates whenever possible; they already connect
the correct CLIP loader and generation node for the model family.

## Models and memory

Place model files in the configured model directories and use the ordinary
model loaders. DynamicVRAM may eject a text encoder or other dependency when
the diffusion model needs its memory, then reload it when required. This is
the same policy used for image and video workflows; do not add a special
offloading node.

## Legacy Transformers nodes

`TransformersLoader` and `TransformersGenerate` remain available for existing
workflows that directly manage a Hugging Face Transformers model. Treat them
as an advanced compatibility path: they do not automatically receive all
native CLIP templates, memory-management decisions, or workflow conveniences.
