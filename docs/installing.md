# Getting started

ComfyUI uses `uv` for environments and dependency resolution. The examples
below never modify `PYTHONPATH` and install the application through the
package facade when binary extensions are needed.

## Linux and macOS

```console
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
mkdir -p "$HOME/ComfyUI_Workspace"
cd "$HOME/ComfyUI_Workspace"
uv venv --python 3.12
uv pip install --torch-backend=auto --extra-index-url https://nodes.appmana.com/simple/ comfyui
source .venv/bin/activate
comfyui serve --guess-settings
```

For NVIDIA extension wheels, install the matching facade variant, for example:

```console
uv pip install --extra-index-url https://nodes.appmana.com/simple/cu130/ sageattention flash-attn
```

Apple Silicon uses the MPS backend selected by `--torch-backend=auto`. Feature
availability follows the installed PyTorch MPS build.

## AMD ROCm

For a supported Linux AMD host, verify `/dev/kfd` and a render node exist, then
install from AMD’s stable TheRock index. The current AppMana image uses the
same host/device split and all-architecture closure:

```console
uv venv --python 3.12
uv pip install --index-url https://stable.repo.amd.com/rocm/whl-next/ \
  torch==2.13.0+rocm10.0.0 \
  torchvision==0.28.0+rocm10.0.0 \
  torchaudio==2.11.0.2+rocm10.0.0
uv pip install --extra-index-url https://nodes.appmana.com/simple/ comfyui
comfyui serve --guess-settings --fp32-vae
```

The generic image includes TheRock device packages for every architecture in
that release and is validated on RX 7600/gfx1102. Do not set
`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` when the installed wheel natively contains the
GPU’s architecture.

## Intel XPU

Install the XPU backend with uv and verify it before starting ComfyUI:

```console
uv venv --python 3.11
uv pip install --torch-backend=xpu --extra-index-url https://nodes.appmana.com/simple/ comfyui
source .venv/bin/activate
python -c "import torch; assert torch.xpu.is_available(); print(torch.xpu.get_device_name(0))"
comfyui serve --guess-settings
```

## Windows

```powershell
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\Documents\ComfyUI_Workspace"
cd "$HOME\Documents\ComfyUI_Workspace"
uv venv --python 3.12
uv pip install --torch-backend=auto --extra-index-url https://nodes.appmana.com/simple/ comfyui
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
comfyui serve --guess-settings
```

## Models and workflows

Known model files can be downloaded on demand. Authenticate with Hugging Face
using its supported CLI, or set `HF_TOKEN` in the process environment. Disable
automatic downloads with `--disable-known-models` when running offline.

Workflow templates are listed with:

```console
comfyui workflows list
comfyui run-workflow <template-or-path> --help
```

## Upgrading

```console
uv pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://nodes.appmana.com/simple/ comfyui
```

Keep accelerator-specific Torch packages pinned when upgrading the application
so uv cannot replace a tested CUDA, XPU, or TheRock stack.

## Memory and performance

DynamicVRAM is the normal memory-management path. It accounts for all selected
devices and can eject inactive model dependencies when memory is needed. Use
`--reserve-vram` for a desktop reservation. `--novram` remains an explicit
compatibility escape hatch and is not required for ordinary constrained runs.

On NVIDIA Ampere and newer, `--fast cublas_ops` and SageAttention may improve
sampling. Measure sampler spans after a warm-up run; end-to-end startup includes
model and custom-node loading and is not a valid iteration-speed comparison.

See [configuration](configuration.md), [distributed inference](distributed.md),
and [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for the current operational details.
