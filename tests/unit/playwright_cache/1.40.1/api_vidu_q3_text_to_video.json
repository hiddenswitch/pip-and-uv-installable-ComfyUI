High-octane action aesthetic with dynamic camera movement, vibrant neon colors against dark streets, motion blur. Photorealistic cinematic quality, RED camera high frame rate for slow-motion capability, anamorphic lens flares from streetlights.\n\nDirector: Justin Lin\nCinematographer: Stephen F. Windon (Fast & Furious franchise)\n\nShot 1 (0-3s): Low-angle tracking shot mounted on car hood. Driver's intense face through windshield, knuckles white gripping steering wheel. Neon signs blur past on either side - streaks of pink, blue, green. He grits teeth and shouts: \"Hold on!\" Yanks wheel hard right. Sound: engine roaring at high RPM, tires screeching on asphalt, wind rushing, EDM bass-heavy music pumping.\n\nShot 2 (3-6s): Exterior wide shot, high angle from above. Car drifts around corner in slow-motion, rear tires smoking, sparks flying from undercarriage scraping pavement. Neon puddle reflections on wet street. Camera rotates 180 degrees following the drift arc. Behind the car, two police cruisers with flashing red-blue lights struggle to make the turn - one clips a parked car, mirror exploding. Final frame: Hero car accelerates away from camera in real-time speed, taillights glowing red, disappearing into tunnel with motion blur streaks. Sound: tire screech extended in slow-mo becoming deep rumble, metal scrape, collision crunch from cop car, then sudden speed-up with doppler shift as hero car rockets away.\n\nColor Grading: Vibrant neon colors - cyan, magenta, yellow - against deep blue-black night. Wet street reflections double all light sources. High contrast with glowing highlights.\n\nAudio: Aggressive mix - powerful engine notes, tire squeals at multiple pitches, metal impacts, doppler shifts. Electronic music with heavy bass drop at the drift moment. Police sirens distant then fading.","seed":1426179949}}}
