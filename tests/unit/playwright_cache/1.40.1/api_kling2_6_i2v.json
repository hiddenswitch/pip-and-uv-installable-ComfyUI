An anthropomorphic green iguana stands confidently in the center, wearing gold-rimmed sunglasses and a stylish blue knitted jacket with a white fur collar. It pulls open the jacket to reveal a multi-layered gold chain with a diamond-encrusted \"C\" pendant. To the left, a wooden bar with liquor bottles illuminated by warm wall sconces. Subtle smoke drifts through the air. In the blurred background, faint neon signs glow, including a yellow Budweiser logo, with indistinct figures of patrons in booths. The camera slowly pushes in on the creature's face, then pulls back. Film noir lighting creates dramatic shadows.\n\nDialog: [The Iguana, deep and confident voice] says, \"Every shadow tells a story. And mine's just getting started.\"\n\nAudio: Ambient club sounds: distant conversations, clinking glasses, ice cubes. A smooth hip-hop beat with deep bass plays in the background. The creature's voice has slight echo and reverb. Subtle rustling of scales and gold chain clinking.\n\nOther: Cinematic, cool, mysterious, hip-hop aesthetic with film noir lighting. Slow, deliberate camera movement.","start_frame":["14",0]}},"14":{"_meta":{"title":"Load Image"},"class_type":"LoadImage","inputs":{"image":"lizard_rapper_in_bar.png"}}}
