On a nighttime baseball field, a boy around 10 years old wearing a Land O'Lakes Explorers Club uniform stands alone at the sideline. The field stretches behind him with distant lights creating a hazy glow. The camera slowly pans right, revealing more of the empty field and emphasizing his solitude.\n\nShot 2: The camera cuts to a low-angle medium shot. The boy looks down at his hands, clenching and unclenching his fists. He takes a deep breath. The camera dollies in slowly toward his face, rising slightly as it moves, ending in a low-angle close-up that makes him appear more determined and heroic.\n\nShot 3: Cut to an extreme close-up of his eyes. His blue eyes shift, pupils dilating slightly. His brow furrows with concentration. The camera holds steady for a moment, then very slowly pushes in even closer.\n\nShot 4: Cut back to a medium close-up at eye level. The boy's expression shifts from nervous to resolute. He lifts his chin slightly and looks directly into the camera. The camera performs a subtle dolly-out while simultaneously zooming in slightly (Hitchcock effect), keeping his face the same size in frame while the background appears to compress, creating a subtle sense of tension and isolation.\n\nEnglish dialogue - the boy speaks in a quiet but firm voice: \"I've been waiting for this moment.\" Pause. \"It's time.\"\n\nBackground sounds: crickets chirping, gentle wind, distant crowd chatter that fades in and out, the metallic clink of a chain-link fence swaying, and a single sharp whistle that punctuates the end of his line. The overall atmosphere is cinematic and introspective.","resolution":"480p","seed":31966473,"watermark":false}},"9":{"_meta":{"title":"Save Video"},"class_type":"SaveVideo","inputs":{"codec":"auto","filename_prefix":"video/seedance","format":"auto","video":["8",0]}}}
