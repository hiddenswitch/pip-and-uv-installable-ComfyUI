In the frame, a monkey in a silver-white spacesuit is intently operating the buttons on the console; next to it, a giraffe, also in a spacesuit, uses its long neck to easily check the instrument panel at a high position; an elephant is securing a large experimental container with its sturdy legs, diligently conducting space experiments; a kangaroo places its joey into a specially made space baby capsule and is checking the life support system inside the capsule itself; there is also a penguin, gliding nimbly inside the capsule, responsible for delivering small experimental samples. Overall, the animals are portrayed as astronauts, creating a novel and busy space exploration scene inside the technologically advanced space capsule. Suspended in the middle of the frame is a huge three-dimensional \"C\" symbol with a glass-like texture, glowing. It is a smooth three-dimensional character with a metallic texture, and the metal shimmers with colorful halos, being a metal art piece that becomes the focal point of the frame.","seed":76371209,"sequential_image_generation":"disabled","size_preset":"2048x2048 (1:1)","watermark":false,"width":2048}},"11":{"_meta":{"title":"Load Image"},"class_type":"LoadImage","inputs":{"image":"comfyui_logo.png"}},"12":{"_meta":{"title":"Save Image"},"class_type":"SaveImage","inputs":{"filename_prefix":"Seedream-4","images":["1",0]}},"21":{"_meta":{"title":"Batch Images"},"class_type":"BatchImagesNode","inputs":{"images.image0":["11",0]}}}
