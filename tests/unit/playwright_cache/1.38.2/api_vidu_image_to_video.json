Low, front-tracking chase shot with subtle handheld shake; shallow depth of field, crisp focus on the leopard\u2019s eyes, then a quick rack focus to paws striking dirt, kicking dust and leaf litter. Muscles ripple under the spotted coat; tail whips for balance; ears pinned; breath puffing in the cool air. Foreground plants streak with fast parallax and natural motion blur; petals and pollen tumble in the slipstream; tiny pebbles flick outward. Speed ramps from quick start to blistering pace. The leopard veers slightly, leaps over a gnarled root, passes within inches of the lens with a whoosh, then streaks past, leaving swirling dust, swaying foliage, and sunlit motes hanging in the air. Ultra-detailed, cinematic, 120fps feel, soft lens flare, vibrant colors, high contrast, realistic shadows.\n","resolution":"1080p","seed":830994375}},"21":{"_meta":{"title":"Save Video"},"class_type":"SaveVideo","inputs":{"codec":"auto","filename_prefix":"video/ComfyUI","format":"auto","video":["20",0]}},"22":{"_meta":{"title":"Load Image"},"class_type":"LoadImage","inputs":{"image":"api_vidu_image_to_video_input_image.png"}}}
