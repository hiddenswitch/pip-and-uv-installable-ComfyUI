Target Product: {user_input}\n\n1. Inputs\nReference Input 1 (Style & Layout): Acts as the strict structural blueprint. This dictates composition, graphic elements, lighting direction, and text layout.\n\nReference Input 2 (Subject): Provides the primary subject matter (product shape, texture, branding).\n\n2. Execution Instructions\nPhase A: Scene & Design Analysis\nEnvironmental Scan: Analyze the perspective, depth, and lighting environment of [Input 1].\n\nDNA Deconstruction: Identify font styles, graphic shapes, and specific noise/grain levels.\n\nPhase B: Object Replacement\nRemoval: Remove the main product currently featured in [Input 1].\n\nInsertion: Insert the product isolated from [Input 2] into the exact focal point and scale defined by the original layout.\n\nPhase C: Text Modification (Content & Style)\nCondition Check: Analyze [Input 1] for existing Copy text elements (excluding text physically on the product).\n\nIf Copy Text Exists: Replace the existing copy with text relevant to the target product. You must replicate the exact font, weight, kerning, and drop-shadows of the original.\n\nIf No Copy Text Exists: Strictly do not generate any text. Preserve the negative space exactly as it appears in [Input 1].\n\nPhase D: Harmonize & Finish\nLighting: Adjust lighting, cast shadows, and reflections on the inserted product to match the environment.\n\nTexture: Apply the original image's texture (film grain, halftone, print artifacts) to the new elements to ensure a cohesive \"print ad\" look.\n\n3. Final Output\nAspect Ratio: Must match Input 1.\n\nQuality: A seamless, professional advertisement where the design layout is preserved, but the subject and color story are synthesized according to the user's preference."}},"14":{"_meta":{"title":"Regex Replace"},"class_type":"RegexReplace","inputs":{"case_insensitive":true,"count":0,"dotall":false,"multiline":false,"regex_pattern":"{user_input}","replace":["15",0],"string":["11",0]}},"15":{"_meta":{"title":"Describe the Product and Ad Copy"},"class_type":"PrimitiveStringMultiline","inputs":{"value":"A ComfyUI branded RTX PRO 6000.
